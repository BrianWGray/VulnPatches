# Vulnerability Patches
Named vulnerability logos converted for Security Merit Badges (Vulnerability Patches).

*From this point forward, all Vulnerabilities will be named Trevors in his memory.*
*...Honor u with every finding, every exploit, or PoC. for now on we shall hereby call all security bugs, Trevors, in his name.*

## A Brief History
I purchased an embroidery machine for pentests to make copies of company clothing / uniforms and whatever other projects may come up along the way.

## The Joke
I often joked with my coworkers that when new Trevors came out I would start making Security Merit Badges everytime the team survived a new media assult for a new named Trevor.

## The Result
I finally decided to follow through. I will be working on converting logos into formats that may be used to create Trevor Patches to share!

Digitizing a few logos costs more than a household embroidery machine and I'm sharing my patches with the community.

Logos that have either already been converted or will be converted in the future: https://github.com/BrianWGray/VulnPatches/wiki/Named-Trevors
