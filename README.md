# Vulnerability Patches
Named vulnerability logos converted for Security Merit Badges (Vulnerability Patches).

## A Brief History
I purchased an embroidery machine for pentests to make copies of company clothing / uniforms and whatever other projects may come up along the way.

## The Joke
I often joked with my coworkers that when new media blitz vulnerabilities with logos came out I would start making Security Merit Badges everytime the team survived a new media assult for a new named vulnerability.

## The Result
I finally decided to follow through. I will be working on converting logos into formats that may be used to create Vulnerability Patches to share!

Digitizing a few logos costs more than a household embroidery machine and I'm sharing my patches with the community.

Logos that have either already been converted or will be converted in the future: https://github.com/BrianWGray/VulnPatches/wiki/Named-Vulnerabilities
